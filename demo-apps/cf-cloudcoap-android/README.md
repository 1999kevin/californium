The californium cloudcoap apps is not longer available.

For backwards compatibility the "android support libraries" have been used, which are part of google's "Android Open Source Project" and is licensed under Apache 2.0.
The libraries are statically linked into the delivery of the app, and therefore requiers a source review by the eclipse IP team.
Unfortunately I'm not able to grant, that I present the right version of the source for these android libraries, especially because many are only included indirect.
For that reason, it's not possible to publish such app on a eclipse project. Thank you, for your understanding!

(This note is just to inform the developer, which already had a look on it. I will remove this branch completely in a couple of days.)
